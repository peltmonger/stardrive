<!-- Scope: optional initial trimming for a project copied without the scaffolding tool, invoked by CONFIG_GUIDE.md. -->

# Trimming Guide

This workflow removes optional demo content from a Stardrive project created by forking the official repository and cloning the fork, cloning the official repository directly, or downloading its source. It applies only when invoked during project configuration by [`CONFIG_GUIDE.md`](./CONFIG_GUIDE.md).

The [`create-stardrive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-stardrive) scaffolding tool performs these removals automatically, so this workflow is only relevant when the project was copied without the scaffolding tool.

Before removing optional features, ask which of these should be retained:

- Blog
- FAQ
- Integration catalog
- Events
- Cloudflare hosting

Remove only features the user explicitly chooses not to retain. Always-on cleanup steps may proceed as documented below.

## Workflow rules

1. **Always-on steps** (marked `always`) do not require an additional feature-retention decision. They remove demo or system files that are not useful in a configured project and can cause conflicts.
2. **Optional steps** (marked `optional`) require explicit confirmation before removal.
3. Before deleting a file or directory, verify that it exists. All paths are relative to the project root containing `package.json`. Report missing elements and continue.
4. After removals, complete the corresponding navigation cleanup and dependency uninstall.
5. Commits are outside this workflow unless requested.
6. Record removed features in [`theme.config.ts`](../theme.config.ts) under the `droppedFeatures` array.

### Context you can share with the user

Stardrive ships as a fully-populated demo site - the same codebase that powers [astro-stardrive.com](https://astro-stardrive.com/). Much of what is included is **example content showcasing the boilerplate's capabilities**, not production content. Demo content is easy to remove, but some features (like the blog) are interwoven and require code edits in addition to file deletions.

---

## Step 1 - System files (always)

Remove the following as part of the always-on cleanup:

- `./SECURITY.md`
- `./CHANGELOG.md`
- `./repository-header.png`
- `./.github` (whole directory)
- `./scripts/syncVersion.js`
- `./public/.well-known/agent-skills` (boilerplate-specific public skill and discovery index)

In the [package.json](../package.json), remove the "prebuild" script, the "sync-version" script, and the `npm run sync-version && ` from the "fix" script.

## Step 2 - Blog feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the blog (built on Astro's content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/utils/blog.ts`
- `./src/utils/reading-time.ts`
- `./src/styles/blog.css`
- `./src/pages/rss.xml.js`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/rss.xml.js`
- `./src/pages/blog`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/blog`
- `./src/layouts/article.astro`
- `./src/images/content/articles-fallback.jpg`
- `./src/images/content/articles`
- `./src/content/articles`
- `./src/components/structured/article.astro`
- `./src/components/blog`
- `./scripts/processSocialImages.js`
- `./public/data/articles`

Then uninstall the package "reading-time": `npm un reading-time` (with npm as package manager).

Then edit:

- `./scripts/postbuild.js` - remove the line `await import('./processSocialImages.js');`
- `./src/content.config.ts` - remove the `const articles` declaration and remove `articles` from the export statement at the bottom.
- `./theme.config.ts` - remove the `articles` section, and remove `addArticles` from the `llms` settings.
- `./astro.config.ts` - remove "reading-time" from the Vite `optimizeDeps`includes.

## Step 3 - FAQ feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the FAQ (also uses content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/content/faq-answers`
- `./src/pages/faq.astro`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/faq.astro`
- `./src/components/faq/`

Then edit:

- `./src/content.config.ts` - remove the `const faq_answers` declaration and `faq_answers` from the export statement at the bottom.
- `./theme.config.ts` - remove `addFAQ` from the `llms` settings.

## Step 4 - Integration catalog feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the integration catalog (also uses content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/images/content/integration`
- `./src/content/integration-options`
- `./src/pages/integration`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/integration`
- `./src/components/integration/`

Then edit:

- `./src/content.config.ts` - remove the `const integration_options` declaration and `integration_options` from the export statement at the bottom
- `./theme.config.ts` - set `onDemandRenderedCollections` and `llms.excludePagesPattern` to `[]` as the default is about integrations

## Step 5 - Events feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the events (built on Astro's content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/utils/event-bridge.ts`
- `./src/styles/events.css`
- `./src/pages/events`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/events`
- `./src/pages/dynamic-events-sitemap.xml.ts`
- `./src/components/events/`
- `./src/content/events`
- `./src/images/content/events`

Then edit:

- `./src/content.config.ts` - remove the `const events` declaration and remove `events` from the export statement at the bottom.
- `./theme.config.ts` - remove the `events` section and `addEvents` from the `llms` settings.
- `./astro.config.ts` - remove the `customSitemaps:` line in the i18n block.

## Step 6 - Cleanup (always, if anything was removed)

- Navigation: Edit `./src/components/layout/nav/footer-nav.astro` and remove navigation entries that point to features which were deleted. Inspect the file and remove only the links for features that no longer exist.
- `./src/content.config.ts`: Set content to `export const collections = {};`.

## Step 7 - Cloudflare specifics (optional)

Ask the user whether they will host on Cloudflare Workers (the boilerplate is preconfigured for it). If they will **not** use Cloudflare, remove:

- `./scripts/purgeCloudflareCache.js`
- `./worker-configuration.d.ts`
- `./wrangler.jsonc`
- `./public/_headers`
- `./public/_redirects`

Then edit `./astro.config.ts` and remove:

- `import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';`
- the `adapter: cloudflare({ (...) })` block

Edit `./package.json` and remove the `purge:cloudflare` script.

Finally, uninstall the dependencies:

```bash
npm un @astrojs/cloudflare wrangler
```

## Step 8 - Adjust .gitignore to used package manager

The `.gitignore` file includes a block "# Lock files". This ignores lock files for the package managers not used.
Adjust this block, if you are not using npm.

## Step 9 - Verify and complete trimming (always)

1. After all edits, verify the project still builds/type-checks cleanly (e.g. run the dev server or build) and fix any references left dangling by the removals.
2. Verify that removed features are recorded in `theme.config.ts`.
3. After successful verification, remove this temporary guide from the configured project. It is only relevant during initial setup.
